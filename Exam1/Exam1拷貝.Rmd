##Problem 1:
Read the help page of the gss_cat data frame from the forcast package.

i. What are the variables?
```{r}
names(gss_cat)
```

ii.What is the class of gss_cat?
```{r}
class(gss_cat)
```

iii. What is the class of each variables?
```{r}
str(gss_cat)
```

iv. Reorder the levels of the `relig`` variable so that the levels are in alphabetical order. write a code that shows the order has been changed. Change order to descending.
```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  select(relig)%>%
   mutate(relig = as.character(relig))%>%
  arrange(desc(relig)) -> gss_cat_relig_desc

gss_cat_relig_desc
```

v. Find the frequency of each categories.
```{r}
sapply(gss_cat, table)
```

vi. Put levels in descending order of how frequently each level occurs in the data
```{r}
gss_cat_level_desc <- gss_cat %>%
  mutate_all(as.factor)%>%
  mutate_all(fct_infreq)

sapply(gss_cat_level_desc, table)
```

vii. Modify the factor levels of marital to be abbreviations of their long-names. For example, “Divorced” can just be “D”
```{r}
gss_cat <- gss_cat %>%
  mutate(marital = recode(marital, "Never married" = "Nm",
                                    "Divorced" = "D",
                                    "Widowed" = "W",
                                    "Married" = "M",
                                    "Separated" = "S",
                                    "No answer" = "Na"))
unique(gss_cat$marital)
```




##Problem 2:
The first two numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence are 0 and 1. Each succeeding number is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. For example, the third element is 1 = 0 + 1, while the fourth elements is 2 = 1 + 1, and the fifth element is 3 = 2 + 1. 

i. Use a for loop to calculate the first 100 Fibonacci Numbers.
```{r}
fibonacci_numbers <- numeric(100) #total of 100
fibonacci_numbers[1] <- 0 #set the first and second number
fibonacci_numbers[2] <- 1

for (i in 3:100) {
  fibonacci_numbers[i] <- fibonacci_numbers[i-1] + fibonacci_numbers[i-2]
}

print(format(fibonacci_numbers, scientific = FALSE)) ## Print Fibonacci numbers in fixed-point notation
```

ii. Return the first 15 Fibonacci Numbers.
```{r}
fibonacci_numbers <- numeric(15)#total of 100
fibonacci_numbers[1] <- 0 #set the first and second number
fibonacci_numbers[2] <- 1

for (i in 3:15) {
   fibonacci_numbers[i] <- fibonacci_numbers[i-1] + fibonacci_numbers[i-2]
}

print(format(fibonacci_numbers, scientific = FALSE))
```

iii. Write a code that finds the nth Fibonacci Number. What is the 30th Fibonacci Number?
```{r}
fibonacci_numbers <- numeric(30)#total of 100
fibonacci_numbers[1] <- 0 #set the first and second number
fibonacci_numbers[2] <- 1

for (i in 3:30) {
   fibonacci_numbers[i] <- fibonacci_numbers[i-1] + fibonacci_numbers[i-2]
}

print(format(fibonacci_numbers[30], scientific = FALSE))
```

Sanity Check: The log2 of the 100th Fibonacci Number is about 67.57.
```{r}
fibonacci_numbers <- numeric(100) #total of 100
fibonacci_numbers[1] <- 0 #set the first and second number
fibonacci_numbers[2] <- 1

for (i in 3:100) {
  fibonacci_numbers[i] <- fibonacci_numbers[i-1] + fibonacci_numbers[i-2]
}

log2_fibonacci_100 <- log2(fibonacci_numbers[100])

log2_fibonacci_100
```

##Problem 3: Load the wmata_ridership data frame into R from https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_412_612/data/wmata_ridership.csv.

i. Save the data in your local machine in your working directory (use write_csv()).  
```{r}
url <- "https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_412_612/data/wmata_ridership.csv" # URL of the data

wmata_ridership <- read_csv(url)# Load the data from the URL

write_csv(wmata_ridership,"wmata_ridership.csv")

```

ii. Upload it into R (use read_csv() and relative path) and name it wmata.  
```{r}
url <- "https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_412_612/data/wmata_ridership.csv" # URL of the data

wmata_ridership <- read_csv(url)# Load the data from the URL

write_csv(wmata_ridership,"wmata_ridership.csv")

wmata <- read_csv("wmata_ridership.csv")
```

iii. what are the variables?
```{r}
names(wmata)
```

iv. Separate variable Date to year, month and day.
```{r}
wmata <- wmata %>%
  mutate(
    Year = year(Date),
    Month = month(Date),
    Day = day(Date)
  )
```

v. For each month, calculate the proportion of rides made on a given day of the month.
```{r}

total_rides_per_month_year <- wmata %>% # Calculate the total number of rides for each month and year
  mutate(
    Month = month(Date),
    Year = year(Date)
  ) %>%
  group_by(Month, Year) %>%
  summarise(TotalRides = sum(Total, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  arrange(Year, Month)


# Calculate the total number of rides for each day
total_rides_per_day <- wmata %>%
  mutate(
    Day = day(Date),
    Month = month(Date),
    Year = year(Date)
  ) %>%
  group_by(Day, Month, Year) %>%
  summarise(TotalRidesDay = sum(Total, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()


# join total rides
total_rides <- total_rides_per_day %>%
  left_join(total_rides_per_month_year, by = c("Month", "Year")) 


total_rides <- total_rides %>%
  mutate(Proportion = TotalRidesDay / TotalRides) #caculate proportion of each month

total_rides
```

vi. Then make box plots of the proportions of ridership vs day of the week. But exclude any days from 2004.
```{r}
total_rides <- wmata%>%
  filter(year(Date) != 2004)%>%
  mutate(
    DayOfWeek = weekdays(Date), # add DayofWeek to show each day
    Month = month(Date),
    Year = year(Date),
    Day = day(Date)
  )%>%
  group_by(Day, Month, Year, DayOfWeek) %>%
  summarise(TotalRidesDay = sum(Total, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  ungroup() %>%
  left_join(total_rides_per_month_year, by = c("Month", "Year")) %>%
  mutate(Proportion = TotalRidesDay / TotalRides)

# ggplot to make boxplot
ggplot(total_rides, aes(x = DayOfWeek, y = Proportion)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Day", y = "Proportion")
```


##Problem 4:
i. Create a new repository in Github. Name it repositoryexam_1
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("repositoryexam_1.png")
```

ii.Drag and Drop 3 files from your desktop to your new repository (any files that you think is appropriate)
```{r}

```

iii. Take a screenshot of the created repository showing evidence of the three files uploaded.
```{r}

```

iv. Now go to the bash terminal and clone the repository back to your Descktop
```{r}

```


##Problem 5:
i. Type your PAT token
```{r}

```

ii. Push the exam_1 file (without solution) to your repositoryexam_1
```{r}

```

iii. Take screenshot and post the url of your Github page that shows the file being pushed along with the commit message “Add exam 1 problems set”
```{r}

```


##Problem6 : You must use data.table package to solve this problem. If you solve it otherwise for instance by tidyverse you get a zero.

Use the nycflights13 package

i. Add the full airline names to the flights data.table.
```{r}

```

ii. Use data.table to calculate the median air time for each month.
```{r}

```

iii. Use data.table to calculate the number of trips from each airport for the carrier code DL.
```{r}

```

iv. Calculate the mean departure delay for each origin in the months of January and February.
```{r}

```


##Problem 7:
The 2010 General Social Survey asked 1,500 US residents: “Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal, or not?” 35% of the respondents said it should be made legal. a. Is 35% a sample statistic or a population parameter? Explain. b. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of US residents who think marijuana should be made legal, and interpret it in the context of the data.
```{r}

```
##Problem 8:
Read up on the ex0330 dataset from the Sleuth3 R package. Determine if education level is associated with income. Interpret any estimates and confidence intervals you derive.
```{r}

```
